# JPIS-Complaint-Manager
A complaint management system to handle student complaints at the boarding house at my high school. Living in the boarding school, there were instances when the curtains in our rooms were torn or our bedroom light wouldn't work or we faced allergy problems due to the food. But, the main issue here was that it was very difficult not just for students to form a complaint, but also for wardens to organize relevant personell such as carpenters or painters working in different parts of the huge school campus to fix these complaints. Because of this complaints would go unsolved or pile up on the warden's desk. 

------------------------------------------

Therefore, to counter this issue, I designed a complaint management system to allow all elements in this process to interact with one another. 

There are several crucial features such as but not limited to:
- seperate administrator and user permissions, dashboards. 
- An analytics system to understand which complaint types were worst addressed. 
- A SMTP (email server) to automatically send carpenters etc. info about the complaint and also send the student confirmation or other relevant information about their respective complaints.
- billing generater to bill students to fix their complaints if required. 
- A user feedback section 
- User data validation

 The core technologies used to implement this software include: 

Front-End: Javascript, Jquery, HTML, CSS (bootstrap)
Backend: Django (Python based web framework)
Database: PostgreSQL (object relational database with support available for interacting with Django Backend)
